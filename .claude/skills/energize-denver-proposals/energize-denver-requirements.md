# Energize Denver Article XIV Requirements

Complete compliance reference for Denver's High-Performance Existing Buildings Program.

## Program Overview

**Purpose**: Require covered building owners to benchmark energy performance and meet performance targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings.

**Goal**: Zero GHG emissions in existing buildings by 2040

**Legal Authority**: Denver Municipal Code Article XIV (Ordinance 1310-21)

## Applicability

### All Buildings ≥5,000 sq ft
- Commercial buildings
- Multifamily buildings
- Mixed-use buildings

### Exclusions
- Buildings without certificate of occupancy for full 12 months
- Buildings under renovation (not occupied for full 12 months)
- Buildings with demolition permits issued and work commenced
- Buildings experiencing qualifying financial distress:
  - Subject to tax lien sale or auction
  - Controlled by court-appointed receiver
  - Acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure
- Manufacturing/agriculture process load buildings (majority of energy for processes, not HVAC/lighting/plug loads)

## Buildings 25,000+ Square Feet

### Benchmarking Requirements (Sec. 10-403)

**Annual Submission**: By June 1 each year, report previous calendar year data

**Platform**: Energy Star Portfolio Manager (or CASR-designated platform)

**Required Data**:
- Annual Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - kBtu/sf/year
- Energy Star Portfolio Manager Score (if eligible)
- Greenhouse gas emissions
- All data fields needed for score calculation and verification

**Record Retention**: Maintain 24 months of monthly utility data, available for CASR inspection

### Performance Requirements (Sec. 10-404)

**Target Years**: 2024, 2027, 2030

**Overall Goal**: 30% total energy savings across all covered buildings by 2030

**Baseline Establishment**:
1. **Existing buildings with 2019 data**: 2019 reported EUI is baseline
2. **No 2019 data available**: CASR establishes reasonable baseline based on building type and available data
3. **New covered buildings**: Predicted EUI from energy code compliance (if available), otherwise CASR establishes baseline

**Target Calculation**:
- Final 2030 target set for each building type to achieve 30% overall savings
- Interim targets (2024, 2027) drawn as straight line from 2019 baseline to 2030 target
- If building type changes, targets updated to align with new type

**Renewable Energy Credits**:
- On-site or off-site renewable power generation credited toward energy use
- Measured in kWh delivered to grid
- Lowers EUI for compliance purposes

**Compliance Demonstration**:
- **June 1, 2025**: Demonstrate 2024 interim target met
- **June 1, 2028**: Demonstrate 2027 interim target met
- **June 1, 2031**: Demonstrate 2030 final target met
- **Ongoing**: Maintain targets indefinitely after achieving

### Alternate Compliance Options

CASR provides flexibility through alternate pathways:

1. **Timing Adjustments**: Process to adjust compliance dates
2. **Target Adjustments**: Modifications for building use or inherent characteristics
3. **Prescriptive Options**: Simplified paths for smaller buildings
4. **Process Load Buildings**: Compliance options where manufacturing/agriculture are primary energy users

### Disclosure Upon Sale

**Required**: Owner must disclose to prospective buyers:
- Compliance status
- All performance targets
- Any approved alternate compliance pathways
- Any penalties assessed

**Disclosure Locations**: All sale documentation including listings, notices, ads, term sheets, contracts

## Manufacturing, Agricultural, and Industrial (MAI) Buildings 25,000+ sf

**MAI Designation**: Buildings where energy is consumed in process loads for manufacturing, agricultural, or industrial purposes.

**Qualified Building Types**:
- Manufacturing facilities
- Agricultural operations (including indoor growing facilities)
- Industrial plants
- Class A data centers
- Food manufacturing facilities
- Drinking water treatment and distribution plants
- Wastewater treatment plants
- Other utilities

**NOT Qualified**: Distribution centers and warehouses (unless they consume energy for MAI process loads)

### MAI Compliance Pathways

MAI buildings must select **ONE** of two pathways:

#### 1. Prescriptive Pathway
**Requirements**:
- ASHRAE Level II energy audit by qualified auditor
- Development of Action Plan with specific upgrades
- Implementation by set deadlines:
  - **Interim: March 1, 2029** (Interim Implementation Report due)
  - **Final: March 1, 2032** (Final Implementation Report due)
- EMV (Energy Monitoring & Verification) Report due June 1, 2033

**Auditor Qualifications**:
- Direct experience performing energy audits at MAI buildings
- Completion of Denver's MAI Energy Auditor Training

**Required Equipment Focus Areas**:
- Compressed air systems
- Industrial motors
- Process loads/manufacturing equipment
- Industrial refrigeration systems

**Prescriptive Requirements**:
- Agricultural facilities with grow lights: Must use DLC-listed horticultural grow lights meeting minimum photosynthetic photon efficacy standards
- Dehumidification and cooling efficiency per 2022 Denver Building Code Section C403.15
- Minimum lighting requirements per Section C405.4

#### 2. Performance Pathway
**Requirements**: Achieve compliance through meeting **ONE** of four performance metrics (no detailed action plan required)

**Available Performance Metrics**:
1. **30% EUI Reduction** from baseline
2. **30% Production Efficiency Improvement** (energy per unit of production)
3. **EUI Score of 52.9** kBtu/sf/year
4. **ENERGY STAR EPI of 75** (Energy Performance Indicator)

**Default Metric** (if no application submitted by Dec 31, 2025):
- 30% EUI reduction OR 52.9 EUI target, whichever is less stringent

**Benchmarking**: First performance year is 2026, with annual June 1 submissions

### MAI Timeline and Deadlines

| Date | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **April 1, 2025** | Default 30% EUI metric assigned to buildings without applications |
| **June 1, 2025** | Annual benchmarking submission (2024 data) |
| **December 31, 2025** | Application deadline for alternate metrics or Prescriptive Pathway |
| **2026** | First performance benchmarking year (for Performance Pathway) |
| **March 1, 2029** | Interim Implementation Report due (Prescriptive Pathway) |
| **March 1, 2032** | Final Implementation Report due (Prescriptive Pathway) |
| **June 1, 2033** | EMV Report due (Prescriptive Pathway) |

### MAI Performance Credits

**Renewable Energy Credit**: On-site or off-site renewable power generation credited toward energy use

**Fossil Fuel Reduction Credit**: Electrification measures can offset performance requirements

### Timeline Adjustments for MAI Buildings

MAI buildings can request extended compliance periods under certain circumstances through CASR application process.

### MAI vs. Standard Commercial Buildings

**Key Differences**:
- MAI buildings have production-based efficiency metrics (not available to standard commercial)
- MAI buildings can choose Prescriptive Pathway (ASHRAE Level II audit + implementation)
- MAI buildings have different baseline and target calculation methods
- MAI buildings have later implementation deadlines (2029/2032 vs. 2025/2028/2031)

   - Achieve equivalent lighting power density to all LEDs

2. **Solar Power**:
   - On-site solar panels, OR
   - Off-site solar purchase
   - Must generate 20% of building's annual energy usage

**Compliance Deadlines by Building Size**:

**Example**:
- Building target: Reduce 100,000 kBtu/year
- Actual reduction: 75,000 kBtu/year
- Shortfall: 25,000 kBtu
- Penalty: 25,000 kBtu × $0.70 = $17,500

### Non-Payment Consequences

**If unpaid after 180 days**:
- Becomes debt to the city
- **Perpetual lien** on property
- Superior to all other liens except:
  - General taxes
  - Prior special assessments
- Interest calculated same as delinquent property taxes
- City may pursue legal action for collection
- Executive Director records lien with Clerk and Recorder

### Enforcement Authority

- **Executive Director of CASR** or designee enforces all provisions
- May issue notices or orders for violations
- Applies to all agents, successors, and assigns of owner

## Key Definitions
