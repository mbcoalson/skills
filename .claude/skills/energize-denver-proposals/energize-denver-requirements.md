# Energize Denver Article XIV Requirements

Complete compliance reference for Denver's High-Performance Existing Buildings Program.

## Program Overview

**Purpose**: Require covered building owners to benchmark energy performance and meet performance targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings.

**Goal**: Zero GHG emissions in existing buildings by 2040

**Legal Authority**: Denver Municipal Code Article XIV (Ordinance 1310-21)

## Applicability

### All Buildings ≥5,000 sq ft
- Commercial buildings
- Multifamily buildings
- Mixed-use buildings

### Exclusions
- Buildings without certificate of occupancy for full 12 months
- Buildings under renovation (not occupied for full 12 months)
- Buildings with demolition permits issued and work commenced
- Buildings experiencing qualifying financial distress:
  - Subject to tax lien sale or auction
  - Controlled by court-appointed receiver
  - Acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure
- Manufacturing/agriculture process load buildings (majority of energy for processes, not HVAC/lighting/plug loads)

## Buildings 25,000+ Square Feet

### Benchmarking Requirements (Sec. 10-403)

**Annual Submission**: By June 1 each year, report previous calendar year data

**Platform**: Energy Star Portfolio Manager (or CASR-designated platform)

**Required Data**:
- Annual Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - kBtu/sf/year
- Energy Star Portfolio Manager Score (if eligible)
- Greenhouse gas emissions
- All data fields needed for score calculation and verification

**Record Retention**: Maintain 24 months of monthly utility data, available for CASR inspection

### Performance Requirements (Sec. 10-404)

**Target Years**: 2024, 2027, 2030

**Overall Goal**: 30% total energy savings across all covered buildings by 2030

**Baseline Establishment**:
1. **Existing buildings with 2019 data**: 2019 reported EUI is baseline
2. **No 2019 data available**: CASR establishes reasonable baseline based on building type and available data
3. **New covered buildings**: Predicted EUI from energy code compliance (if available), otherwise CASR establishes baseline

**Target Calculation**:
- Final 2030 target set for each building type to achieve 30% overall savings
- Interim targets (2024, 2027) drawn as straight line from 2019 baseline to 2030 target
- If building type changes, targets updated to align with new type

**Renewable Energy Credits**:
- On-site or off-site renewable power generation credited toward energy use
- Measured in kWh delivered to grid
- Lowers EUI for compliance purposes

**Compliance Demonstration**:
- **June 1, 2025**: Demonstrate 2024 interim target met
- **June 1, 2028**: Demonstrate 2027 interim target met
- **June 1, 2031**: Demonstrate 2030 final target met
- **Ongoing**: Maintain targets indefinitely after achieving

### Alternate Compliance Options

CASR provides flexibility through alternate pathways:

1. **Timing Adjustments**: Process to adjust compliance dates
2. **Target Adjustments**: Modifications for building use or inherent characteristics
3. **Prescriptive Options**: Simplified paths for smaller buildings
4. **Process Load Buildings**: Compliance options where manufacturing/agriculture are primary energy users

### Disclosure Upon Sale

**Required**: Owner must disclose to prospective buyers:
- Compliance status
- All performance targets
- Any approved alternate compliance pathways
- Any penalties assessed

**Disclosure Locations**: All sale documentation including listings, notices, ads, term sheets, contracts

---

## Manufacturing, Agricultural, and Industrial (MAI) Buildings 25,000+ sf

**MAI Designation**: Buildings where energy is consumed in process loads for manufacturing, agricultural, or industrial purposes.

**Qualified Building Types**:
- Manufacturing facilities
- Agricultural operations (including indoor growing facilities)
- Industrial plants
- Class A data centers
- Food manufacturing facilities
- Drinking water treatment and distribution plants
- Wastewater treatment plants
- Other utilities

**NOT Qualified**: Distribution centers and warehouses (unless they consume energy for MAI process loads)

### MAI Compliance Pathways

MAI buildings must select **ONE** of two pathways:

#### 1. Prescriptive Pathway
**Requirements**:
- ASHRAE Level II energy audit by qualified auditor
- Development of Action Plan with specific upgrades
- Implementation by set deadlines:
  - **Interim: March 1, 2029** (Interim Implementation Report due)
  - **Final: March 1, 2032** (Final Implementation Report due)
- EMV (Energy Monitoring & Verification) Report due June 1, 2033

**Auditor Qualifications**:
- Direct experience performing energy audits at MAI buildings
- Completion of Denver's MAI Energy Auditor Training

**Required Equipment Focus Areas**:
- Compressed air systems
- Industrial motors
- Process loads/manufacturing equipment
- Industrial refrigeration systems

**Prescriptive Requirements**:

- Dehumidification and cooling efficiency per 2022 Denver Building Code Section C403.15
- Minimum lighting requirements per Section C405.4

#### 2. Performance Pathway
**Requirements**: Achieve compliance through meeting **ONE** of four performance metrics (no detailed action plan required)

**Available Performance Metrics**:
1. **30% EUI Reduction** from baseline
2. **30% Production Efficiency Improvement** (energy per unit of production)
3. **EUI Score of 52.9** kBtu/sf/year
4. **ENERGY STAR EPI of 75** (Energy Performance Indicator)

**Default Metric** (if no application submitted by Dec 31, 2025):
- 30% EUI reduction OR 52.9 EUI target, whichever is less stringent

**Benchmarking**: First performance year is 2026, with annual June 1 submissions

---

### Production Efficiency Pathway - Detailed Requirements

**Definition**: MAI buildings can demonstrate 30% production efficiency improvement, meaning **site energy per unit of production falls by 30% relative to baseline**.

This metric suits facilities expecting production growth because they can "measure production efficiency in terms of energy used per widget produced OR energy per some other custom metric."

#### Baseline Establishment

**Baseline Year Options**:
- **Default baseline: 2022** (first benchmarking year)
- **Alternative: Any year 2018-2022** with complete benchmarking data
- **Rationale**: MAI buildings can choose any baseline year from 2018-2022 as long as benchmarking data exists for that year and all subsequent years
- **Atypical years**: If 2022 was unusual (production ramp-up, shutdown, etc.), owners may request a later baseline with justification

**Baseline Calculation Formula**:
```
Baseline Production Efficiency =
  Weather-Normalized Site Energy Use (kBtu) ÷ Total Production Units (baseline year)
```

**Data Requirements**:
- Production data must cover **entire calendar year** ("no more and no less")
- Can backfill previous years by adding rows in Portfolio Manager
- Weather normalization is **required** for energy data
- All production metrics must be entered in Energy Star Portfolio Manager

**If No Baseline Year Data Exists**:
- Choose any year 2018-2022 where production data is available
- No requirement to fabricate missing years
- CASR may establish "reasonable baseline" if no historical data exists (less owner control)

#### Production Metric Definition

**Custom Metric Approval Process**:
- Owners must define production unit (e.g., "widgets", "signs", "gallons treated")
- **CASR approval required** for any custom metric via MAI Alternate Compliance Option (ACO) application
- Metric must represent total production output for the calendar year

**Example Production Metrics** (CASR generic guidance):
- Bakery: Number of loaves of bread baked annually
- Manufacturing: Units/widgets produced
- Print shop: Signs produced, square footage of print material, linear feet (owner-defined, subject to approval)
- Data center: IT load per server rack, per square foot (owner-defined, subject to approval)
- Water/wastewater: Gallons treated, MGD capacity (owner-defined, subject to approval)
- Agriculture: Growing area (sf), crop yield (owner-defined, subject to approval)

**Important**: CASR does not publish a pre-approved list of metrics by industry. Each building must propose and obtain approval for their specific metric.

**Portfolio Manager Setup**:
- Custom metric entered as: "Weather Normalized Site Energy Use (kBtu) per [metric]"
- Annual total production units entered for each calendar year
- Data must be included in Energy Star Data Verification Checklist

#### Target Calculation

**Performance Target Formula**:
```
Target Production Efficiency = Baseline × 0.70 (30% improvement)

Example:
  Baseline: 100 kWh per sign
  Target: 70 kWh per sign (30% reduction)
```

**Compliance Demonstration**:
- Annual benchmarking submission (June 1) with previous calendar year data
- Single-year evaluation (no multi-year averaging allowed)
- Must demonstrate actual production efficiency ≤ target efficiency

**Pathways Using Production Efficiency**:

1. **Performance Pathway**:
   - Demonstrate 30% improvement through annual benchmarking
   - No detailed action plan required
   - First performance year: 2026

2. **Prescriptive Pathway**:
   - Build action plan showing measures to achieve 30% improvement
   - Must document equipment upgrades, costs, savings, ROI
   - Implementation deadlines: Interim 3/1/2029, Final 3/1/2032
   - EMV Report 6/1/2033 must verify 30% savings achieved

#### Application Requirements (Dec 31, 2025 Deadline)

**Required Forms**:
1. **MAI Designation Form** (if not already filed)
2. **MAI Alternate Compliance Option (ACO) Application**
3. **Custom Metric Approval Request** (for production efficiency)

**Supporting Documentation**:
- Baseline production data (chosen year 2018-2022)
- Historical benchmarking data (baseline year through present)
- Production metric definition and justification
- If Prescriptive: Complete Action Plan (see below)

**Action Plan Requirements** (Prescriptive Pathway only):
- List each energy conservation measure (ECM)
- For each ECM:
  - Implementation cost
  - EUI/production efficiency savings
  - Savings-to-investment ratio (SIR)
  - Return on investment (ROI)
  - Total project cost
  - Expected implementation date
- Total must demonstrate 30% production efficiency improvement

#### Ongoing Compliance (Prescriptive Pathway)

**Reporting Deadlines**:
- **March 1, 2029**: Interim Implementation Report
- **March 1, 2032**: Final Implementation Report
- **June 1, 2033**: EMV (Evaluation, Monitoring & Verification) Report

**EMV Report Requirements**:
- Document actual 30% savings achieved (after Renewable/Fossil Fuel credits applied)
- If savings below 20%: Must submit corrective action plan
- If noncompliant: Automatically switched to 30% EUI reduction pathway with penalties

#### Data Quality and Verification

**Verification Requirements**:
- Production data must be entered in Portfolio Manager
- Must provide production data to Energy Star data verifier
- Include verification notes in "Summary of All Associated Metrics"
- **Measured data required** (estimated data not explicitly allowed)

**Data Consistency**:
- Same custom metric must be used each year
- Production totals must represent entire calendar year
- No partial-year or pro-rated data allowed

**Handling Production Changes**:
- Product mix changes: Not explicitly addressed by CASR (gap identified)
- Metric changes: Cannot switch metrics mid-cycle without CASR approval (process unclear)

#### Credits Available for Production Efficiency

**Renewable Energy Credit**:
- On-site or off-site renewable power generation
- Reduces total energy input in production efficiency calculation
- Applicable to both Prescriptive and Performance pathways

**Fossil Fuel Reduction Credit** (MAI-specific):
- If fossil fuel use reduced between baseline and final target years
- CASR applies credit to performance target
- Allowed in action plan tables and EMV evaluations
- Helps achieve 30% production efficiency improvement

**Note**: Electrification Incentive (10% easier target for 80% electric buildings) applies to non-MAI buildings only. MAI buildings use Fossil Fuel Reduction Credit instead.

#### Decision Criteria: When to Choose Production Efficiency

**Production Efficiency Pathway Favored If**:
- ✅ Production expected to **expand/grow**
- ✅ Process loads are significant portion of total energy (>50%)
- ✅ Reliable production data exists (2018-2022 baseline available)
- ✅ Production metric is clear and measurable
- ✅ Already implemented process-related efficiency upgrades

**Whole-Building 30% EUI Reduction Favored If**:
- ❌ No reliable production data (or cannot establish tracking)
- ❌ Production stable or declining
- ❌ Energy dominated by HVAC/lighting (not production-dependent)
- ❌ Product mix highly variable (difficult to normalize)

**CASR Recommendation**: "Choose production efficiency if production is expected to expand" and consult with MAI-trained auditor to identify best metric and measures.

#### Penalties for Production Efficiency Non-Compliance

**Penalty Calculation**:
- Based on **kBtu shortfall** between target and actual performance
- Shortfall = (Actual Production Efficiency - Target Production Efficiency) × Total Production Units
- Convert to kBtu shortfall, then multiply by penalty rate

**Updated Penalty Rates** (April 2025):
- **$0.15/kBtu**: Buildings on standard updated timeline
- **$0.23/kBtu**: Buildings opted into 2028/2032 timeline
- **$0.35/kBtu**: Buildings granted timeline extensions
- **+$0.10/kBtu surcharge**: Extensions requested after target year ends

**Example Penalty Calculation**:
```
Building on 2028/2032 timeline with production efficiency shortfall:
  Shortfall: 20,000 kBtu
  Rate: $0.23/kBtu
  Penalty: 20,000 × $0.23 = $4,600
```

**Prescriptive Pathway Failure**:
- Automatically switched to 30% EUI reduction performance pathway
- Penalized based on EUI target gap (not production efficiency)

**Enforcement Process**:
1. CASR notifies owner of non-compliance
2. 90 days to file corrective action plan or timeline extension
3. Notice of violation issued if no response
4. Administrative citation and penalties assessed
5. Unpaid penalties become property liens after 180 days

#### Timeline Extensions for MAI Buildings

**Extension Types**:

1. **Interim Compliance Hold**: Two-year pause for temporary issues
2. **Timeline Extension**: Long-term adjustment with owner-developed compliance plan

**Valid Reasons for Extension**:
- End-of-life equipment replacement planning
- Major renovations in progress
- Whole-building electrification projects
- District steam system limitations
- Energy service capacity constraints (requires Xcel documentation)
- Innovative projects causing implementation delays
- Under-resourced situations (case-by-case)

**Application Requirements**:
- Online Timeline Extension application form
- ASHRAE Level II audit (submitted via DOE Audit Template Tool)
- Detailed compliance plan (CASR template) showing:
  - Specific measures with timelines
  - Financing strategy
  - Expected savings verification
- Capacity Constraint Response Template (if applicable)

**Timing Considerations**:
- Can apply anytime, but **applying after target year ends** triggers higher penalty rates (+$0.10/kBtu surcharge)
- Standard timeline opt-in: Shifts interim to 2028, final to 2032
- Custom extensions: Adjust targets as justified by compliance plan

**Execution Requirements**:
- Must execute compliance plan during extension period
- Failure to execute plan triggers higher penalties
- Multiple extensions: Not explicitly addressed (gap identified)

#### Known Gaps and Limitations

**Information NOT Published by CASR**:
1. Pre-approved production metrics by industry type
2. Handling product mix changes or metric normalization over time
3. Process for changing metrics after ACO application approval
4. MAI ACO application review timeline
5. Treatment of estimated production data or partial-year gaps
6. Procedure for incomplete or rejected applications
7. Whether multiple timeline extensions are allowed
8. Specific process load percentage thresholds for pathway selection

**Questions Requiring Direct CASR Contact**:
1. What production metrics has CASR already approved for specific industries (print shops, data centers, water treatment)?
2. How to document and normalize production when product mix changes significantly year-to-year?
3. Can buildings switch from production efficiency to another metric after ACO approval, and what is the process?
4. What is expected review timeline for ACO applications submitted near Dec 31, 2025 deadline?
5. Does CASR permit estimated/modeled production data when measured records unavailable?
6. Can owners request multiple timeline extensions?

**Workarounds for Gaps**:
- Product mix changes: Define metric broadly (e.g., "sf of print material" vs "number of signs") to accommodate variety
- Missing data: Choose baseline year where data exists (2018-2022 flexibility)
- Uncertainty: Request extension to establish tracking systems before committing to pathway
