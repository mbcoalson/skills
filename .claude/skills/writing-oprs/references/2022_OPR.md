# OVERVIEW AND INSTRUCTIONS

The Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR) documents the function of a project and expectations of the building use and operation. The document describes the physical and functional building characteristics desired by the Owner and establishes performance and acceptance criteria.

The Owner refers to [Owner Organization Name].

The Commissioning (Cx) provider assumes responsibility for updating the OPR throughout the design, construction, and post‐occupancy period. As decisions are made during the life of the project, this document shall be updated to reflect the current requirements of the Owner.

The purpose of this document is to provide clear and concise documentation of the Owner’s goals, expectations, and requirements for all systems, and shall be utilized throughout the project delivery to provide an informed baseline and focus for design and development and for validating systems’ energy and environmental performance.

The OPR is a required document for compliance with LEED certification of the project but also serves other purposes:

Provides the design team with the information necessary to develop the Basis of Design (BOD) during programming and/or schematic design, and shall serve as a “road map” for the development of the design and construction documents.

Provides the Construction Team Training, Turnover, and other project goals for the Owner to consider the project successful.

Provides the Cx team with tangible benchmarks to measure success & quality and confirm that the building and systems are constructed to align with the Owner’s expectations and requirements.

Provides the project team with the information necessary to develop the Construction Documents and Systems Manual.

The OPR should be approved before the approval of any Contractor equipment and systems submittals.

# INTRODUCTION

This document is designed to systematically communicate the expectations of the Owner to the design team and help them understand what they are tasked with achieving. Additionally, the OPR provides a mechanism by which designers can respond to, and describe how they are meeting the Owner’s requirements. The document includes initial requirements and as the design progresses additional information will be added to the OPR as needed until the construction documents have been completed and the project’s construction phase begins.

Owner is a long-term building occupant and owner. Any design requirements that will create a deviation from the objectives or project intent provided in this document shall be discussed, acknowledged, and approved by the Owner.

Include the intended hardware, communication protocol, physical location, responsible contractor, and operational features.

### Acoustical Requirements

The following levels should be achieved in the spaces in the DCEP.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type of Space | Recommended NC Level  NC Curve | Equivalent Sound Level (dBA) |
| Office | 30-35 | 40-45 |
| Conference Room | 25-30 | 35-40 |
| Support Areas | 40-45 | 45-50 |
| Mechanical / Electrical Spaces | 45-55 | 55-65 |

### Vibration Requirements

Vibration from the HVAC/R equipment shall not be transmitted where it is felt by the occupants.

### Seismic Requirements

Provide seismic restraints as required by building code.

### Furnishings and Equipment

The design team shall work with Owner and other stakeholders to determine the furnishings required for the project. Additional information on space types shall be included in the Design Team BOD.

The A/E shall be responsible for the coordination of all building utilities and equipment to the selected furnishings.

### Accessibility Requirements

Equipment shall be accessible to the operations and maintenance staff. Upper levels and roofs shall have service elevators for access.

System overrides shall be included in the controls system for after-hour operation by the occupants.

### Aesthetics Requirements

Interior Renderings must be produced for design approval to depict the look of key spaces within the building. Renderings must accurately represent the forms and materials of the proposed design solutions.

### Constructability Requirements

The DBC should perform a thorough check of the Construction Documents before issuance of the bid and/or permit set to ensure that the drawings are clear on the full scope of the project and that details have been designed in a constructible manner.

### Operation and Maintenance Criteria

The contractor is required to provide the information required in the Contractor Turnover Package (CoTP) for the project as described in the Project Documentation section of the OPR.

A Systems Manual is required for LEED Enhanced Commissioning. This manual provides the Owner with a single source of information and instructions for proper operation and maintenance of primary building systems. As opposed to equipment-oriented “O&M manuals,” the Systems Manual is to be systems-oriented to provide operators with easy access to both narrative and technically detailed reference material, descriptions, diagrams, schedules, and other information on stand-alone and, particularly, integrated systems.

Like the OPR and BOD, the Systems Manual should be a living document. Unlike the OPR and BOD, though, the Systems Manual should evolve throughout the life of the building – complied by the Commissioning Team from documentation developed by the owner, design team, contractors, and the commissioning process itself then turned over for perpetual use and upkeep by building operators and future consultants and contractors throughout the building's life.

### Training for Equipment and System Maintainability Expectations

This facility will be primarily operated by operation and maintenance personnel. It is expected that the necessary personnel training will be allocated within the project specifications concerning hours per piece of equipment, system and/or sub-system.

The construction team will provide a training plan describing the training topics to be discussed and their duration. This plan will ensure that the training sessions are effective in transferring the necessary knowledge to operate and maintain the building in its current optimized state. Emphasis should be placed on learning the regular activities associated with the building automation system such as checking alarms, resetting alarms, checking set points, trending information, etc. as these will be the basic tool to indicate items requiring attention and/or maintenance.

The A/E should also have a training session to go over the phasing of the equipment and the intended operation of the systems.

### Quality Requirements of Materials and Construction

The quality of construction must meet or exceed that described in the Architect’s specifications.

The CM and Architect should work together to define these standards and specifications during design, but in no case should these be below industry standards or go against the Owner Standards without a written and approved deviation request.

Materials recommended for approval are expected to be durable and maintainable in keeping with the anticipated long life of the building. Materials that have not been tested in the marketplace for significant periods should not be considered for this project.

# QUALITY ASSURANCE / QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC)

The design and construction teams shall develop a QA/QC plan to be approved by Owner Facility department. The QA/QC plan shall include the process, frequency, and communication methods and identify protocols for transparency in accordance with the ISO 9000 family of requirements.

# COMMISSIONING PROCESS

The commissioning process for buildings and systems as detailed in ASHRAE Guidelines 0 and ASHRAE Standard 202-2018 describes a quality-oriented process for achieving, verifying, and documenting the performance of the facility, systems, and assemblies to meet the Owner’s defined objectives and criteria as defined in this document. The focus of the commissioning process is on key systems, assemblies, and energy-related equipment.

The commissioning process is a quality-based method to achieve successful construction projects. It is not an additional layer of construction or project management. Commissioning reduces the cost of delivering construction projects and increases the value to Owner‘s occupants and end-users. The process shall ensure the design, construction, turnover, and operation of the facility, procured by Owner, are documented and delivered in accordance with the Building Program and Owner’s project requirements.

The focus of the commissioning process is on key systems, assemblies, and energy-related equipment including but not limited to:

Mechanical systems –AHUs and FCUs, VAVs, VFDs, TAB verification, air distribution system, chilled water system.

Electrical Systems –lighting controls and power monitoring and metering.

Building automation systems (BAS) – HVAC control systems

Domestic hot water systems

Renewable Energy Systems – None at this time

Owner is utilizing a third party commissioning provider with a direct contract to the owner.

# PROJECT COMPLETION & FINAL ACCEPTANCE

Provide Contractor Turnover Package (CoTP) that includes but is not limited to the following: O&M manuals, Warranty data, As-built documents, and Record Documents.

Provide General Guidelines for Project Sponsored Training.

Building Automation System (BAS) training shall be provided in the operation and maintenance of the system. The manufacturer and the controls contractor shall also provide training maintenance personnel in the following areas:

1. Programming logic changes
2. Expansion of the control system including hardware and software additions
3. Graphics
4. HVAC Controls Systems
5. Integrated Systems
