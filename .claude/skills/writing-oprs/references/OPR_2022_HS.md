**Introduction**

Purpose

The Owner’s Project Requirement document is a collection of minimal performance expectations, objectives, and general criteria associated with the design and construction of a project. The document is intended for use by a wide audience. Through continued development, the document will ensure that the project and owner goals align and that benefits achieved are continued during building occupancy and operation. The typical audience will include the design team, construction team, building users, maintenance staff, energy management team, and future renovation teams, as well as anyone who needs access to the original project information.

The Owner’s Project Requirements / Design Intent document is not a substitute for traditional architectural programming. While it does contain beneficial programming information such as space usage, its primary contents are the owner’s goals, expectations, performance, and success criteria as discussed above.

The following owner’s program requirements were developed as part of the Owner’s project planning process and establish the baseline criteria for facility function, performance, sustainability, and maintainability. The document shall assist in the creation of the project’s Basis of Design (BOD) developed by the architect/engineer (A/E) team. The BOD is meant to translate the School District’s and Users’ outlined needs, as specified within this OPR, into building components such as the building envelope, heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, electrical, plumbing, and telecommunication systems, life safety systems, etc.

As decisions are made during the course of the project, the Owner’s Project Requirements’ document is updated to reflect any changes to the original project goals, thereby becoming a record of these decisions. In this way, the OPR is a living document. The document should also be amended to include any future modifications and/or upgrades to [Project Name].

Owner Requirements Covered Elsewhere

1. General Planning and Design Guidelines
2. Existing site conditions and constraints
3. Project space types, finishes, M/E/P/FP systems, telecommunications and data, audio-visual systems and acoustical requirements by space
4. Codes, ordinances, guidelines, and standards

The OPR is intended to fulfill three vital purposes in its development:

1. Provide the team with enough information to develop the project Basis of Design (referenced above) during program verification and/or schematic design, and to serve as a roadmap for design development and construction documents.
2. Provide the commissioning provider (CxP) with tangible benchmarks to measure project success and quality, as well as confirm the constructed / installed building systems align with the School District’s and Users’ expectations.
3. Serves (in concert with the BOD) as a foundation for the project Systems Manual.

The Owner has developed these project requirements with assistance from the CxP. The refinement and augmentation of this document throughout design, construction, and one-year post occupancy will be assigned to the project CxP.

1. INTRODUCTION
2. *Introduction*

This document is designed to systematically and clearly communicate the expectations of the Owner to the design team and help them understand what they are tasked with achieving. Additionally, the OPR provides a mechanism by which designers can respond to and describe how they are meeting the School District’s requirements. The document includes initial requirements and as the design progresses additional information will be added to the OPR as needed until the construction documents have been completed and the project’s construction phase begins.

The Owner is a long-term building occupant and owner. All project decisions shall be made while taking this into consideration. Any design requirements that will create a deviation from the objectives or project intent provided in this document shall be discussed, acknowledged, and approved by the School District.
