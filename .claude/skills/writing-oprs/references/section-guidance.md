## Section 2: Owner's Goals and Objectives

### Purpose
Capture the owner's vision, priorities, and success criteria for the project.

### Key Content

**Mission and Vision**
- Why is the owner undertaking this project?
- What problem does it solve or need does it meet?
- How does it align with organizational mission?

**Primary Objectives**
Ranked or categorized by priority:
- Occupant comfort and health
- Energy efficiency and sustainability
- Operational reliability and ease of maintenance
- First cost vs. lifecycle cost priorities
- Building aesthetics and occupant experience
- Flexibility for future changes

**Success Criteria**
Define what "success" looks like:
- Performance targets (energy, comfort, etc.)
- Certification goals (LEED, ENERGY STAR, etc.)
- Budget and schedule adherence
- Operational cost targets

**Constraints and Priorities**
- Budget limitations
- Schedule requirements
- Operational disruptions (occupied renovations)
- Special considerations (historic preservation, noise, etc.)

### Writing Tips
- Conduct structured owner interviews to capture goals
- Use the owner's language and terminology
- Be specific about priorities - not everything can be #1
- Include measurable success criteria where possible
- Document trade-off decisions (e.g., "Owner prioritizes low first cost over long-term energy savings")

### Example Goal Statements

**Vague**: "The owner wants an energy-efficient building"

**Specific**: "The owner's primary goal is to achieve ENERGY STAR certification with a score of 75 or higher and reduce annual utility costs by 30% compared to the existing facility, supporting the organization's goal of carbon neutrality by 2030."

- Training requirements

### Example: HVAC Systems Narrative

**System Purpose**
"The HVAC system shall provide thermal comfort and indoor air quality for office workers and visitors in the building. The system will serve approximately 25,000 SF of office space across three floors, operating weekdays from 6 AM to 10 PM with reduced setback operation at night and weekends."

**Performance Requirements**
- Temperature: 72°F ± 2°F during occupied hours in office spaces
- Humidity: 30% to 60% relative humidity year-round
- Ventilation: Minimum outdoor air per ASHRAE 62.1-2019 for office occupancy (5 CFM/person + 0.06 CFM/SF)
- Filtration: MERV 13 minimum filtration
- Noise: Maximum NC 35 in open office areas, NC 30 in conference rooms
- Equipment Efficiency: Minimum ASHRAE 90.1-2019 requirements, with preference for ENERGY STAR certified equipment where available

**Operational Requirements**
- Automatic temperature setback to 65°F during unoccupied hours
- Optimal start/stop to achieve setpoints by occupancy time
- Local temperature adjustment capability of ± 2°F in individual zones
- Integration with occupancy sensors for demand-controlled ventilation
- BAS monitoring and alarm notification for equipment failures

**Maintenance Considerations**
- All equipment accessible for maintenance without disrupting occupied spaces
- Filter access without requiring ladders or lifts
- Parts standardization preferred (single manufacturer for all VAV boxes, for example)
- Remote diagnostics capability for major equipment
- O&M training for facilities staff

### Writing Tips

**Focus on WHAT, not HOW**
- ❌ "Install a 150-ton air-cooled chiller with magnetic bearing compressor"
- ✅ "Provide chilled water cooling with total capacity of 150 tons at design conditions (95°F outdoor, 75°F indoor), with equipment efficiency of at least 0.85 kW/ton at AHRI conditions"

**Use Performance Language**
- State desired outcomes, not specific equipment or methods
- Allow design team flexibility in how to meet requirements
- Reserve prescriptive requirements for critical owner needs (brand standardization, specific protocols, etc.)

**Align with Owner's Goals**
- If owner prioritizes low maintenance, emphasize reliability and access
- If owner prioritizes efficiency, emphasize performance targets and monitoring
- Reference back to Section 2 goals

---

## Cross-Cutting Considerations

### Consistency Across Sections
- Ensure systems requirements (Section 3) align with owner's goals (Section 2)
- Verify IEQ requirements (Section 4) are reflected in system performance criteria
- Confirm energy targets (Section 5) are achievable with system requirements
- Check that commissioning scope (Section 6) covers all critical performance criteria

### Progressive Development
- Early design: Focus on goals, objectives, and general performance targets
- Mid-design: Refine system requirements as design develops
- Late design: Finalize specific acceptance criteria for commissioning

The OPR is a living document that should be updated as the project evolves and owner priorities are refined.

### Owner Review and Approval
- Review draft OPR with owner early and often
- Use review meetings to clarify priorities and resolve conflicts
- Obtain formal owner sign-off before proceeding to Basis of Design
- Update OPR if significant design changes occur

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Writing the Basis of Design instead of OPR**
   - OPR: "Maintain 72°F ± 2°F during occupied hours"
   - BOD: "Install VAV system with DDC controls and reheat coils"

2. **Vague, unmeasurable requirements**
   - See measurable-criteria-guide.md for guidance

3. **Copy-paste from previous projects without customization**
   - Every owner and project is unique
   - Conduct actual owner interviews, don't assume

4. **Ignoring budget and operational reality**
   - Specify requirements the owner can afford to build and operate
   - Discuss trade-offs openly

5. **Excessive technical jargon**
   - Write for the owner, not for engineers
   - Explain technical terms or use plain language

6. **Missing the "why"**
   - Don't just state requirements, explain the owner's reasoning
   - Connect requirements back to goals and objectives

## Document Formatting and Structure

### Version Control
- Date and version number on each page
- Track revisions with revision history table
- Identify sections changed in each revision

### Organization
- Clear section numbering
- Table of contents with page numbers
- Consistent formatting and style
- Use tables for system-by-system requirements

### Appendices
Consider including:
- Owner interview notes
- Relevant standards and code sections
- Utility rate schedules
- Existing building performance data
- Related studies (energy audits, facility assessments, etc.)

### Length and Detail
- Typical OPR: 20-50 pages for most projects
- More complex projects may be longer
- Focus on quality over quantity - be concise and specific
- Use tables and bullet points for readability
