Invoke this skill when working with:
- **Energize Denver compliance questions** - Requirements, deadlines, penalties
- **Denver Article XIV regulations** - Building performance policy details
- **MAI buildings** - Manufacturing, Agricultural, Industrial compliance pathways
- **Performance targets** - Baseline calculations, interim/final targets (2024/2027/2030)
- **Compliance pathways** - Whole-building EUI, production efficiency, prescriptive paths
- **Benchmarking requirements** - Annual submission rules, Energy Star Portfolio Manager
- **Penalty calculations** - Rates, shortfall calculations, enforcement
- **Timeline extensions** - Application process, valid reasons, requirements
- **Alternate compliance options** - Timing adjustments, target modifications

## What This Skill Provides

**Regulatory Knowledge**:
- Complete Article XIV requirements by building size and type
- MAI production efficiency pathway (detailed guidance)
- Performance target calculation methods
- Penalty rates and enforcement procedures
- Deadline and milestone tracking
- Alternate compliance application requirements

**Decision Support**:
- Pathway selection criteria (EUI vs production efficiency vs prescriptive)
- Compliance vs penalty cost analysis
- Timeline extension eligibility assessment

## What This Skill Does NOT Cover

- ❌ Pricing or scoping Energize Denver services → Use **writing-proposals** skill

## Quick Reference

### Building Categories

**25,000+ sf (Non-MAI)**:
- Annual benchmarking (due June 1)
- Performance targets: 2024, 2027, 2030
- Baseline: Typically 2019 EUI
- Compliance metric: 30% EUI reduction by 2030

**25,000+ sf (MAI Buildings)**:
- Two pathway options: Prescriptive or Performance
- Performance metrics: 30% EUI reduction OR 30% production efficiency OR 52.9 EUI OR ENERGY STAR 75
- First performance year: 2026
- Application deadline: December 31, 2025

**5,000-24,999 sf**:
- LED lighting OR 20% solar by deadline
- Deadlines: Dec 31, 2025/2026/2027 (by size tier)

### Key Deadlines

| Date | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **June 1 (annual)** | Benchmarking submission (25k+ sf) |
| **December 31, 2025** | MAI ACO application deadline |
| **December 31, 2025** | Small buildings 15k-25k sf LED/solar |
| **December 31, 2026** | Small buildings 10k-15k sf LED/solar |
| **December 31, 2027** | Small buildings 5k-10k sf LED/solar |
| **June 1, 2025** | Demonstrate 2024 target compliance |
| **June 1, 2028** | Demonstrate 2027 target compliance |
| **June 1, 2031** | Demonstrate 2030 target compliance |

### Penalty Rates (Updated April 2025)

**Standard Commercial Buildings (25,000+ sf)**:
- $0.15/kBtu - Buildings on standard updated timeline
- $0.23/kBtu - Buildings opted into 2028/2032 timeline
- $0.35/kBtu - Buildings granted timeline extensions
- +$0.10/kBtu surcharge - Extensions requested after target year ends

**MAI Buildings**: Same rates apply to production efficiency shortfalls

## How to Use This Skill

### Answer Regulatory Questions

When the user asks about Energize Denver requirements:

1. **Identify the question type**:
   - Building applicability and exclusions?
   - Compliance pathway selection?
   - Performance target calculation?
   - Penalty calculation?
   - Deadline or milestone?
   - Application requirements?

2. **Consult the detailed requirements**:
   - See [./article-xiv-requirements.md](./article-xiv-requirements.md) for complete regulatory reference

3. **Provide specific, actionable answers**:
   - Cite specific sections and requirements
   - Include deadlines, formulas, and rates
   - Explain implications and decision criteria

### Pathway Selection Guidance

When helping users choose compliance pathways:

**For MAI Buildings**, evaluate:
- Production growth expectations
- Production metric clarity and measurability
- Availability of historical production data (2018-2022)
- Process load percentage vs HVAC/lighting
- See [./article-xiv-requirements.md](./article-xiv-requirements.md) → "Production Efficiency Pathway - Detailed Requirements"

**For Standard Commercial Buildings**, evaluate:
- Current EUI vs performance targets
- Feasibility of operational improvements
- Capital improvement budget
- Renewable energy options
- Timeline flexibility needs

### Penalty Calculations

When calculating potential penalties:

1. **Determine shortfall**: Target kBtu reduction - Actual kBtu reduction
2. **Identify penalty rate**: Based on timeline status (see rates above)
3. **Calculate penalty**: Shortfall (kBtu) × Penalty Rate ($/kBtu)
4. **Consider timeline**: Multi-year penalties for ongoing non-compliance

Example from requirements document:
```
Building on 2028/2032 timeline:
  Shortfall: 20,000 kBtu
  Rate: $0.23/kBtu
  Penalty: $4,600
```

### Timeline Extensions

When users ask about timeline extensions:

**Valid Reasons** (from Article XIV):
- End-of-life equipment replacement planning
- Major renovations in progress
- Whole-building electrification projects
- District steam system limitations
- Energy service capacity constraints (requires Xcel documentation)
- Innovative projects causing delays

**Application Requirements**:
- ASHRAE Level II audit
- Detailed compliance plan (CASR template)
- Financing strategy
- Specific measures with timelines

**Important**: Applying after target year ends triggers +$0.10/kBtu surcharge

See [./article-xiv-requirements.md](./article-xiv-requirements.md) → "Timeline Extensions for MAI Buildings" (also applicable to standard buildings)

## Cross-References to Other Skills

**When pricing or scoping Energize Denver services**, use the **writing-proposals** skill:
- ASHRAE Level 1/2/3 audit pricing
- Benchmarking service scoping
- Compliance pathway consulting pricing
- Proposal generation and formatting

**Example collaborative workflow**:
- User: "Create Energize Denver MAI proposal for print shop"
- **energize-denver** (this skill): Identify MAI pathway requirements, production efficiency metric selection, Dec 31 deadline
- **writing-proposals**: Price ASHRAE Level II audit, structure scope of work, generate proposal document

## Known Gaps and Limitations

When consulting [./article-xiv-requirements.md](./article-xiv-requirements.md), note the "Known Gaps and Limitations" section identifies:
- Pre-approved production metrics by industry (not published by CASR)
- Product mix change handling for production efficiency
- Metric change procedures after ACO approval
- MAI ACO application review timelines

**For these questions**, recommend direct CASR contact: energizedenver@denvergov.org

## Important Notes

**This skill provides regulatory guidance only**. It does not:
- Price services (use **writing-proposals** skill)
- Provide detailed engineering analysis
- Substitute for legal counsel
- Replace official CASR guidance

**Always verify**:
- Current penalty rates with CASR (rates updated April 2025)
- Application deadlines and requirements
- Specific building applicability before providing advice

**Data quality matters**:
- Production efficiency requires measured data (estimated data not explicitly allowed)
- Weather normalization required for energy data
- Complete calendar year coverage required (no partial-year data)
