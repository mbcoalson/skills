## Cost Analysis Tools

### NPV Analysis Email Generator

**Purpose:** Generate lifecycle cost analysis summaries for energy efficiency measures and design alternatives

**Location:** `scripts/npv_analysis_email_generator.py`

**Documentation:** [`docs/TOOL_SECC_NPV_Email_Generator.md`](../../docs/TOOL_SECC_NPV_Email_Generator.md)

**When to Use:**
- Comparing energy efficiency measure costs vs. savings over lifecycle
- Evaluating HVAC system alternatives (baseline vs. high-efficiency)
- Generating cost comparison reports for LEED energy models
- Creating stakeholder-ready summaries of first costs and NPV

**Common Workflow:**

1. Run energy models for baseline and alternatives
2. Extract annual energy costs from simulation results
3. Input costs into NPV spreadsheet (Assumptions, Upfront_Costs, Cashflows_XNPV sheets)
4. Recalculate formulas if needed
5. Generate formatted summary:
   ```bash
   python scripts/npv_analysis_email_generator.py "path/to/NPV_Analysis.xlsx" \
     -o "path/to/Summary.xlsx" \
     -p "Project Name"
   ```

**Output:**
- Excel summary with color-coded cost comparisons
- Highlights lowest lifecycle cost option
- Ready for client presentations and stakeholder communication

**Integration:**
- Use **xlsx skill** to edit NPV spreadsheet and recalculate formulas
- Use **work-command-center** to track NPV summary as deliverable
- Use **diagnosing-energy-models** for HVAC alternative modeling

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Compare lifecycle costs of GSHP vs. conventional HVAC"
- "Generate NPV summary for LEED cost-benefit analysis"
- "Create stakeholder report showing first cost vs. 25-year savings"
