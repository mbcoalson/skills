# Energy Model Diagnostics Skill

Systematic troubleshooting, validation, and repair workflows for OpenStudio and EnergyPlus energy models. Particularly useful for LEED projects, complex HVAC systems, and models with geometry errors.

**Key Principle**: All recommendations must be validated against authoritative sources before implementation.

---

## VALIDATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

**Before providing ANY fix recommendations**, validate your approach using these authoritative sources in priority order:

### Required Validation Steps

1. **Check OpenStudio Documentation FIRST** (Primary Source - MANDATORY for geometry and HVAC)
   - Use WebFetch: https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/
   - **Version**: OpenStudio 3.9 (default unless specified otherwise)
   - **For**: Geometry issues, HVAC system setup and connections, OpenStudio workflows
   - **Priority Rule**: ALWAYS check OpenStudio docs BEFORE any other source for geometry fixes and HVAC solutions

2. **Search Unmet Hours Community** (Secondary Source - Use with Caution)
   - Use WebSearch: `site:unmethours.com [topic] openstudio`
   - **For**: Real-world troubleshooting, edge cases not in official docs
   - **Caution**: Prioritize answers from well-regarded contributors (NREL staff, Big Ladder Software, high-karma users)
   - **When NOT to use**: As primary source when OpenStudio docs provide clear guidance
   - If Unmet Hours contradicts OpenStudio docs → Trust OpenStudio docs

3. **Reference EnergyPlus Documentation** (Object-Level Details)
   - Use WebFetch: https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/24-2/input-output-reference/
   - **Version**: EnergyPlus 24.2 (aligns with OpenStudio 3.9)
   - **For**: EnergyPlus object requirements, field definitions, simulation errors

### Validation Checklist

Before recommending any fix:
- [ ] Checked OpenStudio 3.9 documentation FIRST (mandatory for geometry/HVAC)
- [ ] If using Unmet Hours: Verified contributor reputation and answer quality
- [ ] Verified approach compatible with OpenStudio 3.9 / EnergyPlus 24.2
- [ ] Cross-validated if sources conflict (OpenStudio docs take precedence)
- [ ] Included brief source citation in recommendation

**See [validation-sources.md](./validation-sources.md) for detailed instructions on version-specific docs and contributor evaluation.**

---

## Common Error Patterns

**Six major patterns account for most model failures.**

For detailed symptoms, root causes, and step-by-step fixes, see **[common-error-patterns.md](./common-error-patterns.md)**

### Quick Reference

**Pattern 1: Overlapping Building Stories**
- Multiple stories with same Z-coordinate (typically Z=0)
- Causes severe geometry errors, simulation failure
- **Fix**: Consolidate spaces onto correct physical floor levels
- **Validate before fixing**: Check OpenStudio geometry documentation

**Pattern 2: Non-Planar Surfaces**
- Vertices not coplanar, typically from SketchUp geometry
- Causes simulation warnings or failures
- **Fix**: Delete and recreate using OpenStudio SketchUp plugin tools
- **Validate before fixing**: Search Unmet Hours for non-planar surface solutions

**Pattern 3: Unassigned Thermal Zones**
- Spaces without zones or orphaned zones without spaces
- Causes HVAC errors, simulation failure
- **Fix**: Create zone assignment matrix, assign systematically
- **Validate before fixing**: Check OpenStudio thermal zone documentation

**Pattern 4: Missing HVAC Connections**
- Components not connected to plant loops
- Node connection mismatches
- **Fix**: Delete and re-add using proper OpenStudio workflow
- **Validate before fixing**: Check OpenStudio HVAC docs + Unmet Hours

**Pattern 5: Surface Matching Failures**
- Adjacent surfaces not matched (red in 3D view)
- **Fix**: Run surface matching algorithm, check story organization
- **Validate before fixing**: Check OpenStudio surface matching documentation

**Pattern 6: Schedule Type Mismatches**
- Wrong schedule type limits for object field
- **Fix**: Verify required schedule type in EnergyPlus I/O Reference
- **Validate before fixing**: Check EnergyPlus documentation

---

## Diagnostic Workflows

**Five systematic workflows for common scenarios.**

For detailed step-by-step procedures, see **[diagnostic-workflows.md](./diagnostic-workflows.md)**

### Workflow 1: Model Triage (5-10 minutes)

**When**: Model fails to simulate or has unexpected behavior

**Quick Steps**:
1. Check story organization (flag duplicate Z-coordinates)
2. Validate surfaces (count, check for anomalies, intersections)
3. Verify zone assignments (spaces have zones, zones have spaces)
4. Check HVAC topology (plant loops, air loops, terminals connected)
5. Attempt simulation, parse top errors

**Output**: Prioritized list of blocking issues

**Before providing fixes**: Validate approach for each issue type using [validation-sources.md](./validation-sources.md)

### Workflow 2: Geometry Rebuild Decision (15-20 minutes)

**When**: Considering whether to fix or rebuild geometry

**Decision Criteria**:
- **Fix**: <10 intersecting surfaces, correct story organization, high preservation value
- **Rebuild**: >10 intersecting surfaces, multiple stories at Z=0, systemic issues
- **Hybrid**: Extract valuable components, rebuild geometry, reapply

**Time Estimates**:
- Small fix (<5 surfaces): 1-2 hours
- Medium fix (5-10 surfaces): 3-5 hours
- Small building rebuild (<20k sf): 4-8 hours
- Large building rebuild (50-100k sf): 16-24 hours

**Before recommending**: Validate geometry best practices with OpenStudio documentation

### Workflow 3: EOR Specification Mapping (30-45 minutes)

**When**: Starting new model or validating zone assignments

**Key Steps**:
1. Gather EOR documents (mechanical drawings, equipment schedules, BOD)
2. Create equipment matrix (equipment ID, type, spaces served, capacities)
3. Create space assignment matrix (space → zone → equipment → terminal)
4. Validate model against matrices
5. Generate validation report with discrepancies

**Output**: Validated mapping between spaces and EOR equipment

**Before providing recommendations**: Cross-reference EOR specs carefully, validate HVAC approach with OpenStudio docs

### Workflow 4: LEED Baseline Generation

**When**: Ready to create ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G baseline model

**See [leed-compliance-procedures.md](./leed-compliance-procedures.md) for comprehensive procedures.**

**High-Level Steps**:
1. Verify proposed model completeness (simulation runs, matches EOR)
2. Apply Appendix G transformations (envelope, lighting, HVAC)
3. Create 4 rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
4. Run all models, calculate averaged baseline
5. Calculate percent savings
6. Verify unmet hours <300 for all models
7. Generate LEED documentation

**Before baseline generation**: Validate Appendix G requirements for project's ASHRAE 90.1 version and climate zone

### Workflow 5: Systematic Error Resolution

**When**: Multiple simulation errors need methodical resolution

**Key Steps**:
1. Parse error file, categorize by severity and type
2. Prioritize: Severe/fatal → Warnings → Info
3. **Validate fix approaches** using authoritative sources (critical step)
4. Apply fixes iteratively (fix 1-3 errors, re-run, repeat)
5. Document fixes and results

**Before providing fixes**: For EACH error, validate solution approach using [validation-sources.md](./validation-sources.md)

- HVAC: Table G3.1.1-1 system selection by building type, size, heating source
- Equipment efficiencies: Tables 6.8.1-X

**Rotation Analysis**:
- Create 4 baseline orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
- Average baseline results
- Proposed stays as-designed (1 simulation)

**Percent Savings**:
- ECB = Average of 4 baseline energy costs
- Savings = (ECB - Proposed) / ECB × 100%
