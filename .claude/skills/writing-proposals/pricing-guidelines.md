Pricing models, factors, and guidelines for energy consulting services.

## Pricing Philosophy

Energy consulting pricing balances:
1. **Value to Client**: Cost of service vs. potential savings/penalty avoidance
2. **Scope Complexity**: Building size, systems, data quality
3. **Market Competitiveness**: Regional consulting market rates
4. **Internal Costs**: Staff time, tools, overhead

## Pricing Models

### 1. Fixed Fee
**When to Use**: Clear scope, predictable effort, straightforward buildings

**Advantages**:
- Client budget certainty
- Incentivizes efficiency
- Simpler contracting

**Risks**:
- Scope creep
- Unforeseen complexity
- Data quality issues

**Best For**:
- Benchmarking
- Level 1 audits
- Performance target analysis
- Standard compliance pathways

### 2. Time & Materials with Not-To-Exceed (T&M NTE)
**When to Use**: Uncertain scope, data quality unknown, complex buildings

**Advantages**:
- Flexibility for scope changes

- NTE cap provides client budget protection

**Best For**:
- First-time benchmarking (unknown data issues)
- Complex compliance pathways
- Buildings with incomplete documentation
- Portfolio work with variable building conditions

### 3. Tiered by Building Size
**When to Use**: Portfolio work, multiple similar buildings

**Structure**:
- Small (25k-50k sf): Tier 1 pricing
- Medium (50k-100k sf): Tier 2 pricing
- Large (100k-200k sf): Tier 3 pricing
- Very Large (200k+ sf): Tier 4 pricing

**Advantages**:
- Simple, transparent pricing
- Volume discounts for portfolios
- Easy for clients to budget

**Best For**:
- Benchmarking services for property managers

- **Model**: Can use T&M for trust-based relationship
- **Loyalty Benefit**: 5-10% discount or priority scheduling
- **Retainer Option**: Annual benchmarking + on-call consulting

### Portfolio Clients (Property Managers)
- **Approach**: Volume pricing, multi-year agreements
- **Model**: Tiered by building size with portfolio discount
- **Discount**: 15-30% for 3+ buildings
- **Value Add**: Dashboard reporting, proactive compliance tracking

### Institutional Clients (Universities, Hospitals, Government)

## Value Proposition Development

### Cost Avoidance Example

When pricing compliance work, help clients understand penalty avoidance:

**Example**: 100k sf building, 25 kBtu/sf shortfall from performance target

- **Annual shortfall**: 100,000 sf × 25 kBtu/sf = 2,500,000 kBtu
- **Annual penalty**: 2,500,000 kBtu × $0.70/kBtu = **$1,750,000 per year**
- **5-year penalty (2030-2035)**: $1,750,000 × 5 = **$8,750,000**

**Value of compliance pathway consulting ($25,000)**:
- Avoids $8.75M in penalties over 5 years
- **ROI: 350:1**

This makes even expensive audits and improvements cost-effective compared to non-compliance.

### Energy Savings ROI

For operational improvement and capital projects:
- Calculate annual energy savings (kWh, therms, $)
- Show simple payback period
- Calculate NPV and IRR for capital improvements
- Compare audit cost to potential savings identified
