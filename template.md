## Iconergy's Proposed Commissioning Tasks

Based on our understanding of the project, Iconergy proposes to provide
the following services:

+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Task   | Commissioning Task                                            |
| \#     |                                                               |
+:======:+===============================================================+
| **1**  | **Design Review and Commissioning Specifications:** Iconergy  |
|        | will review the CDs and any addenda for completeness and to   |
|        | verify that they meet the owner's requirements. Comments will |
|        | be reviewed during design meetings.                           |
|        |                                                               |
|        | Iconergy will provide commissioning specifications for        |
|        | inclusion in the project specifications. These documents      |
|        | prepare contractors for the commissioning process and make    |
|        | commissioning a contract requirement.                         |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **2**  | **Commissioning Plan:** The Plan outlines roles and           |
|        | responsibilities for the team, as well as describes the       |
|        | commissioning tasks and schedule.                             |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **3**  | **Submittal Reviews:** Iconergy will review the contractor\'s |
|        | submittals that are applicable to the commissioning scope to  |
|        | ensure that the equipment or system provided meets the design |
|        | intent. Reviews shall occur concurrently with the design      |
|        | team.                                                         |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **4**  | **Meetings**: Lead a commissioning coordination meeting to    |
|        | review the commissioning scope of work, tasks, schedules,     |
|        | deliverables, and responsibilities with the general           |
|        | contractor and their subcontractors. The meeting shall occur  |
|        | after the start of construction and shall be in person or     |
|        | virtual with the general contractor and MEP subcontractors.   |
|        |                                                               |
|        | Lead a control review meeting to review inputs, outputs and   |
|        | control sequences of operation with the control's contractor  |
|        | and DPS.                                                      |
|        |                                                               |
|        | Coordinate and attend commissioning meetings throughout       |
|        | construction to coordinate activities, gauge readiness for    |
|        | testing and review open issues with the team. Allowance is    |
|        | provided for monthly meetings from rough-in through trim, and |
|        | then bi-weekly meetings from startup through closeout. The    |
|        | meetings will be both onsite and remote.                      |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **5**  | **Site Observations:** On-site review of piping, duct,        |
|        | equipment installation, and startup procedures with the       |
|        | equipment vendors. For each observation, Iconergy will        |
|        | develop a report summarizing progress and any corrective      |
|        | action.                                                       |
|        |                                                               |
|        | - Proposed Site Visit Schedule:                               |
|        |                                                               |
|        | - MEP Rough-In, Trim and Equipment Install (quantity)         |
|        |                                                               |
|        | - AHU Startup                                                 |
|        |                                                               |
|        | - Lighting Control Startup                                    |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **6**  | **Write Functional Performance Tests:** Draft test procedures |
|        | for functional testing activity. Test plans to include all    |
|        | points and modes of operation. We will be in close touch with |
|        | the engineer of record to discuss questions that arise        |
|        | throughout this process.                                      |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **7**  | **Installation Checklists:** Review check sheets provided by  |
|        | the installation contractors to document details of           |
|        | installation for each piece of equipment. Collect and review  |
|        | completed checklists and startup reports.                     |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **8**  | **Functional Testing:** Coordinate, witness, and document     |
|        | functional performance tests. Coordinate retesting as         |
|        | necessary. The commissioning agent (CxA)'s time for multiple  |
|        | retests, if required due to no fault of the CxA, will be      |
|        | compensated by the construction team. The functional testing  |
|        | shall include operating the system and components through     |
|        | each of the written sequences of operation, and other         |
|        | significant modes and sequences, including startup, shutdown, |
|        | unoccupied mode, manual mode, staging, miscellaneous alarms,  |
|        | power failure and interlocks with other systems or equipment. |
|        |                                                               |
|        | Sensors and actuators shall be spot-checked for proper        |
|        | calibration**.** Functional testing shall be executed using   |
|        | conventional manual methods, control system trend logs, and   |
|        | read-outs or stand-alone data loggers, to provide a high      |
|        | level of confidence in proper system function, as deemed      |
|        | appropriate by the CxA.                                       |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **9**  | **Maintain a master issues log:** Report all issues as they   |
|        | occur directly to the project team. Provide written progress  |
|        | reports and test results with recommended actions. Each issue |
|        | will be assigned to the party responsible for correcting the  |
|        | issue.                                                        |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **10** | **Test, Adjust and Balance Verification:** Iconergy will      |
|        | schedule time onsite with the balance contractor to verify    |
|        | balance methods and procedures. The verification procedure    |
|        | will include spot checking air and water flow rates and       |
|        | locations selected by Iconergy. Once balancing is complete,   |
|        | Iconergy will review the balance report for accuracy and      |
|        | thoroughness. This effort will be coordinated to occur during |
|        | the same trip as functional testing (task 8).                 |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **11** | **O&M and Training:** Iconergy will verify that the O&M       |
|        | manual has been prepared by the contractor and meets the      |
|        | specified requirements. In addition, Iconergy will ensure     |
|        | training is adequate.                                         |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **12** | **Final Report:** Compile a Commissioning Summary Report,     |
|        | which shall include:                                          |
|        |                                                               |
